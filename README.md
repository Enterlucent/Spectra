# Spectra

Spectra is a space station management game with RPG and RTS elements.  This project is for getting/contributing modding resources, to submit questions/issues or to get general information.

## Getting Started
* [Getting Information](#how-to-get-information "Getting Information]") - Where the documentation can be found
* [Support Questions](#how-to-open-a-support-question "Support Questions") - Check to see if any one else has had the same question.
* [Bug Report](#how-to-submit-a-bug-report "Support Questions") - Check to see if any one else has had the same problem.
* [Feature Requests](#how-to-open-a-feature-request "Support Questions") - Check to see if any one else has had the same idea.
* [Site Mention](#how-to-request-site-mention "Site Mention") - Do something Spectra related and would like for us to link to it?

## How to Open a Support Question
1. Determine if your question has already been [asked by others](https://github.com/Enterlucent/spectra/issues?q=label%3Aquestion+is%3Aall)
    * If you find the question then there's no need to open another ticket.
    * If you do not feel the question has been thoroughly answered, then comment on it and ask for more clarification
2. Create a [Question Issue](https://github.com/Enterlucent/spectra/issues/new?template=Custom.md)
    * Add [?] to the title of your Issue _(ie [?] How Do I Install This Game?)_
    * Try to be as detailed as possible
    * Try to use clear and direct language as much as possible
3. Check back, or enable the notification options, to see the answer to your question
    * Keep in mind that everyone is here in their free time and there may be gaps when responses are slow.    Feel free to set the notification settings for the question so you'll know immediately when its answered.

## How to Open a Bug Report<a id="how-to-submit-a-bug-report"></a>
1. Determine if the bug has already been [reported](https://github.com/Enterlucent/spectra/issues?q=label%3Abug+is%3Aopen)
    * If you find that the Issue has already been opened then a new Issue is not needed.
    * Feel free to add your experiences to bug reports and to reopen bug Issues if it crops up again.
2. Create a "Bug Report" on the [Issues page](https://github.com/Enterlucent/spectra/issues/new?template=Bug_report.md).
    * Add [BUG] to the title of your issue _(ie [BUG] Cats Get Too Many Cheeseburgers)_
    * Make sure that you are very detailed with what you are experiencing
3. Check back often, or enable the notification options, in case others have questions or need further clarification

## How to Open a Feature Request<a id="how-to-open-a-feature-request"></a>
1. Determine if the same or similar [Feature Requests](https://github.com/Enterlucent/spectra/issues?q=label%3Aenhancement+is%3Aopen+-label%3Adocumentation) already exists.
    * If one does exist, feel free to expand upon it by commenting on the Issue but **do not open a new one**.
2. Create a [Feature Request](https://github.com/Enterlucent/spectra/issues/new?template=Feature_request.md) on the Issues page.
    * If your Feature Request requires additional/changed documentation then a [Documentation Request](CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-open-a-documentation-request) is also required
        * You must provide a reference to the Documentation Request in the Feature Request Issue
    * Make sure that you are very detailed with what you think the feature should accomplish, how it should be implemented and it's predicted effect on other features.
3. Check back often, or enable the notification options, in the event others have questions about your proposal
4. You will know when the feature is accepted when the "approved" label is assigned to it
    * If there are multiple requests as a part of the feature, the feature will not be moved to the master branch until all dependent parts have been completed.
    * It is important to keep in mind that all new features, even simple changes, often have wide ranging effect which need to be fully explored.
    * Also remember that not all features can be added into the game (but I'm sure we'll try!) and features need to be released in an orderly way so even if the feature is accepted it may not go in immediately.
